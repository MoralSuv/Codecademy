To run a c script you need to compile it in the terminal and then you can run it:

Here is how that works:

1. Use gcc to run the compiler application in terminal
###  % gcc script1.c -o script1
gcc is the compiler
script1.c is the script
and -o script1 lets gcc know what we want to name the executable

2. To run executable:
### % ./script1
